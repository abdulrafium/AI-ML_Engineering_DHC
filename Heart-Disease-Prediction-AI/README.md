# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🔹 Task Objective
I aimed to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease using medical and health-related data. The task focuses on binary classification and medical data interpretation.

---

## 🔹 Dataset Used
I used the Heart Disease UCI dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes attributes such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, blood pressure, and heart rate.

---

## 🔹 Models Applied
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

---

## 🔹 Methodology
1. I cleaned and explored the dataset.
2. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. I scaled the features for better model performance.
4. I trained classification models.
5. I evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.
6. I analyzed feature importance to understand medical relevance.

---

## 🔹 Key Results
- Logistic Regression achieved better generalization.
- ROC-AUC scores showed strong classification capability.
- Chest pain type, heart rate, and ST depression were important predictors.

---

## 🔹 Conclusion
I demonstrated how machine learning can assist in predicting heart disease risk. While the model provides valuable insights, it should be used as a supportive tool alongside professional medical evaluation.
