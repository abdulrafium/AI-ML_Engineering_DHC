# House Price Prediction

## 🔹 Task Objective
I predicted house prices using property features such as Rooms, Bathroom, BuildingArea, Distance, and RegionName.

## 🔹 Dataset
House Price Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.

## 🔹 Models Applied
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## 🔹 Methodology
1. Preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical features, scaled numeric features)
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Trained models and generated predictions
4. Evaluated models using MAE and RMSE
5. Visualized predicted vs actual prices
6. Identified important features affecting price

## 🔹 Key Results
- Gradient Boosting outperformed Linear Regression
- Rooms, BuildingArea, Distance, and RegionName were the most important features
